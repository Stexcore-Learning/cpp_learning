# 🧪 C++ Programming Examples by Steven Aray

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly to intermediate-level C++ examples, designed to demonstrate core language concepts including loops, conditionals, functions, character manipulation, pattern printing, and prime factorization.

## 🔧 Build Instructions

### 📦 Using CMake (Recommended)

Make sure you have CMake installed (v3.16 or higher), then run:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build/
cmake --build build/
```

This will compile each `.cpp` file under the `examples/` directory into its own executable.

Run any example with:

```bash
./build/example_name
```

For example:

```bash
./build/5_extract_prime_factors
```
